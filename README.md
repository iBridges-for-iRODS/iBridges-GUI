## About

The git repository contains a generic *iRODS* graphical user interface.  The iRODS functionality is based on [ibridges](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/iBridges) and works with any *iRODS* instance.  

![](docs/screenshots/metadata.png)
  
## Highlights

- Works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux: [supported versions](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/supported-platforms.html)

- Runs on Python 3.9 or higher.
- Supported iRODS server versions: 4.2.11 or higher and 4.3.0 or higher.
- **Upload** and **Download** your data.
- Manipulate the **metadata** on the iRODS server.
- **Synchronize** your data between your local computer and the iRODS server.
- **Search** through all metadata for your dataset or collection.
- Safe default options when working with your data.

## Prebuild executable <alpha>
There are prebuild executables available for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu.
You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/iBridges-for-iRODS/iBridges-GUI/releases/latest).
The build was done using the latest version on an x64 architecture.

## Installation
- The python package 

  ```bash
  pip install ibridgesgui
  ```
  
- A specific branch of the git repository (testers, developers)

  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/iBridges-for-iRODS/iBridges-GUI.git@branch-name
  ```
  
- Locally from code (for developers)

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:iBridges-for-iRODS/iBridges-Gui.git
  cd iBridges-Gui
  pip install ".[all]"
  ```
  
## Start the GUI
- From a pip python package

  ```bash
  ibridges-gui
  ```
- From code (for developers)

  ```bash
  python ibridgesgui/__main__.py
  ```

## Executables
Since iBridges version 1.4.0 we offer pre-built executables. These executables can also be built from source.
Please note, that this feature is still in experimental state.

### Prebuilt executables
Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/iBridges-for-iRODS/iBridges-GUI/releases). In the latest releases you will find three zip-files, these contain the prebuilt application.
Download the respective zip-file for your system and unpack it. In the unpacked folder there is a file `ibridges_gui.[exe, sh]`
For Windows simply click on the exe-file, for Mac and Linux open the file with a shell `bash ./ibridges_gui.sh`.


### Building Executables

We offer build scripts in case you would like to compile iBridges and distribute the executable.

```
python3 build_tools/build_script.py -h

usage: build_script.py [-h] [--debug_exe] [--rem_venv]
                       [--code_folder CODE_FOLDER] [--ui_folder UI_FOLDER]
                       [--icons_folder ICONS_FOLDER] [--venv VENV]

iBridges-Gui exe creator.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug_exe           Build executable with debug console
  --rem_venv            remove virtual environment
  --code_folder CODE_FOLDER
                        Full path to the directory with code
  --ui_folder UI_FOLDER
                        Full path to the directory with ui files
  --icons_folder ICONS_FOLDER
                        Full path to the directory with the icons
  --venv VENV           Full path to virtual python environment
```

This will create a virtual environment `venv` in your iBridges folder. Next to that you will find a new folder `build` and `ibridgesgui_dist`. The executable can be found and started like this for Mac and Linux:

```
./output/ibridgesgui/ibridges_gui.bin
```

For Windows simply click on the file `output/ibridgesgui/ibridges_gui.exe`.

## Extending iBridges-GUI (for developers)
iBridges-GUI supports Plugins. You can create a plugin for your own tab and it will be detected and run by the main application when it is installed.
We provide a small guide and template structure [here](https://github.com/iBridges-for-iRODS/ibridges-gui-tab-example).
